# Python_Libraries_for_Data_Analytics


## üìç Mission
The mission of this repository is to provide beginners with an easy-to-follow guide on the most popular Python libraries used in data analytics. We aim to provide clear and concise explanations, as well as practical examples, of how to use these libraries to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data. Our goal is to empower individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the field of data analytics.

## üîÜ Introduction

Data analytics is a rapidly growing field, and Python has become a popular choice for data analysts and scientists due to its flexibility and ease of use. Python has a vast array of libraries specifically designed for data analytics, which can be used to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.

## ü•≥ Features

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library that can be used to create a variety of charts and graphs. It provides a wide range of customization options to create professional-looking visualizations. Some of the popular types of charts that can be created using Matplotlib include scatter plots, line charts, histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.

### NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, which provides powerful tools for working with arrays and matrices. NumPy arrays are much faster than regular Python lists for numerical operations, making them ideal for data analysis. NumPy arrays are used extensively in other data analysis libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

### Pandas

Pandas is a library that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. It allows data to be manipulated and analyzed in a variety of ways, including filtering, merging, grouping, and reshaping. Pandas is designed to work with both small and large datasets and has a range of functions for reading data from a variety of sources such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and JSON.
