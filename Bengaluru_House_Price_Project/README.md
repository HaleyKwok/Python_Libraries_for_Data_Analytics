# Bengaluru House Price Project

Welcome to the Data Science Practice repository! This repository is designed to help you practice your data science skills, from data cleaning to model building to packaging your code into a Flask app.

## ðŸ”§ Software and Environment

### Software
In this repository, we will be using the following software:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- VS Code (or another code editor of your choice)
- Postman (for testing APIs)
- Flask (for building APIs)

## ðŸ“‚ Folder
To get started, clone this repository onto your local machine. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the Data_Science_Practice folder in your terminal or command prompt.

## Virtual Environment
We recommend that you create a virtual environment to work in. To create a virtual environment, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

This will create a new virtual environment named env. To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:
```bash
python -m venv env
```

If you are using Windows, the command is:
```
source env/bin/activate
```

## ðŸ’¾ Model

### Data Cleaning
Before we build our model, we need to clean our data. Here are the steps we will take to clean our data:
- Understand the features in our dataset
- Drop any features that we don't need
- Drop any null values
- Check for inconsistent units and convert them to a consistent unit
- Convert any decimals to the appropriate format

### Feature Engineering
Once our data is cleaned, we can start feature engineering. Here are some techniques we can use:
- Change the format of a feature
- Remove specified characters from the beginning or end of a string
- Combine similar features
- Remove outliers

### Model Building
After feature engineering, we can start building our model. Here are the steps we will take:

- One hot encode the location feature
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Build a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluate the model using the score method
- Optimize the model using GridSearchCV

### Packaging
Once our model is built, we can package it into a Flask app. Here are the steps we will take:
- Save our model using pickle
- Create a Flask server using Flask
- Create a client-side interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Test our app using Postman

### Final Product
The final product of this practice repository will be a Flask app that takes in a set of features and predicts the price of a home in Bangalore, India.

## Summary

In this repository, we practiced our data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and packaging skills. We built a Flask app that can predict the price of a home in Bangalore, India.
